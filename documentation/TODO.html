<h1>TODO</h1>
<h2>printer</h2>
<p>pv/printer.h is not used.</p>
<h2>doxygen</h2>
<p>There is a lot of public code that does not have doxygen tags.</p>
<h2>postMonitor: PVUnion, PVUnionArray, and PVStructureArray</h2>
<p>PVUnion, PVUnionArray, and PVStructureArray all have elements
that are treated like a top level field.</p>
<p>Currently if a subField of any of these is changed postMonitor is not called for the field itself.</p>
<p>David asked if this could be changed so that it is called.
Marty thinks this may not be a good idea.</p>
<h2>timeStamp, display, control, and valueAlarm</h2>
<p>normativeTypes.html defines time_t,  display_t, control_t, and alarmlimit_t.
The definitions are not compatible with how property defined timeStamp, display, control, and valueAlarm.
The definition of alarm_t does match the definition of property alarm.</p>
<h2>monitorPlugin</h2>
<p>A debate is on-going about what semantics should be.</p>
